# Insights for MINGAR's Marketing and Product Considerations
**A statistical analysis on user profile and deficiency investigation for MINGAR devices** <br>
Report prepared for MINGAR by Highland Consulting Group

MINGAR is a Canadian company developing towards high-end outdoor fitness trackers. To overcome its biggest competitor, Bitfit, who focuses on more economic products, MINGAR expanded its market share by innovating devices with new function and more affordable prices. Thus, it is crucial for MINGAR to understand its user portrait for both new and traditional devices. Customer satisfaction is likewise an important indicator to compete with Bitfit. As MINGAR received comments from customers about the device’s tendency to malfunction on darker skin, we will analyze the influence of skin color on product performance. Therefore, this report uses customer data since August 2015 and device detection sleep data in January 2022 to explore MINGAR’s customers distributions for different types of devices, as well as factors that are related to the triggering of quality flags, particularly for sleep score recordings.
